## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Achievement

### Backend Excellence
```python
# Clean Architecture Implementation

├── main.py              # FastAPI application entry point
├── core/               # Core utilities and configuration
├── database/           # Database models and session management
├── routers/           # API route handlers (8 modules)
├── schemas/           # Pydantic models for validation
├── services/          # Business logic layer
└── tests/             # Comprehensive test suite

# Key Technical Decisions:
✅ Dependency Injection with FastAPI
✅ Repository Pattern for data access
✅ Service Layer for business logic
✅ Comprehensive input validation
✅ Proper error handling and logging
```

### Database Design Excellence
```sql
-- Advanced Relationship Example
CREATE TABLE players (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    team_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER CHECK(age >= 16 AND age <= 50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams (id),
    UNIQUE(team_id, name),  -- Prevent duplicate players per team
    INDEX idx_players_team_position (team_id, position),
    INDEX idx_players_age (age)
);

-- Complex Analytics Query Example  
SELECT 
    t.name as team_name,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.team_a_score > m.team_b_score AND m.team_a_id = t.id 
               OR m.team_a_score < m.team_b_score AND m.team_b_id = t.id 
          THEN 1 END) as wins,
    COUNT(m.id) as total_matches,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.team_a_id = t.id THEN m.team_a_score 
                   ELSE m.team_b_score END), 2) as avg_goals_for
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN matches m ON (t.id = m.team_a_id OR t.id = m.team_b_id)
WHERE m.is_finished = true
GROUP BY t.id, t.name
ORDER BY wins DESC;
```
