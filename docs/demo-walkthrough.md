## 🤔 Anticipated Q&A

### Technical Questions
**Q**: *"How does the system handle concurrent updates to match scores?"*  
**A**: "SQLAlchemy provides transaction isolation, and we use database-level constraints to ensure data integrity. In production, we'd implement optimistic locking for concurrent access."

**Q**: *"What's the database performance like with large datasets?"*  
**A**: "We've implemented strategic indexing on all foreign keys and search columns. The system includes pagination and can handle thousands of records efficiently."

**Q**: *"How secure is the authentication system?"*  
**A**: "We use JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing, role-based access control, and comprehensive input validation. All security vulnerabilities have been addressed."

### Business Questions
**Q**: *"How would this scale for multiple leagues?"*  
**A**: "The current design supports single-league operations. For multi-tenant scenarios, we'd add league_id foreign keys and implement tenant isolation."

**Q**: *"Can this system handle real-time score updates?"*  
**A**: "The current REST API supports score updates. For real-time capabilities, we'd add WebSocket support for live score broadcasting."
